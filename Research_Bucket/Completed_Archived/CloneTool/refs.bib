  abstract = {Malware is a worldwide epidemic. Studies suggest that the impact of
	malware is getting worse. Malware detectors are the primary tools
	in defense against malware. The quality of such a detector is determined
	by the techniques it uses. It is therefore imperative that we study
	malware detection techniques and understand their strengths and limitations.
	This survey examines 45 malware detection techniques and offers an
	opportunity to compare them against one another aiding in the decision
	making process involved with developing a secure application/system.
	The survey also provides a comprehensive bibliography as an aid to
	researchers in malware detection},
