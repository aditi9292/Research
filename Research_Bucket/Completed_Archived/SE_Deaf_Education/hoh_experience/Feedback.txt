Minor Comments:
o Page 2 Line 31: Reference [23] may be sufficient here.
X Page 3, 2nd column, Line9: Sentence starts with "Figure 1 ..." is 
incomplete. 

Although the cohort of student were from software engineering, there are not 
software specific content in the paper. These observations may equally be 
applied for many discipline.



======= Review 2 =======

The paper is projecting a good idea, but the data analysis is a bit on the 
shorter side. If more figures can be used to represent the collected data, 
i feel it would make more easier reading. 

X There is a section on page 3 PART B where i think there is some missing 
text.

Overall if the paper could be revised well, it might shed light on an area 
which is often neglected
