I tried signing with him, but I think it made him uncomfortable, so then I stopped, but the whole group could tell he didn't really know what was going on, so he just kind of zoned out during all of our meetings.","Only one (that I mentioned above).  I didn't enjoy the experience because it was hard to communicate (because the deaf person had a hard time with both english and sign language).  Normally, I would have been fine with the experience, because I know ASL fluently.","It's nice to have an interpreter, but its not always possible.  I am NOT an interpreting major, but have been forced to attempt some amateur interpreting in the past out of necessity.","I worked with a hard of hearing student on a project once who was not from America, and didn't know sign language.  I tried signing with him, but I think it made him uncomfortable, so then I stopped, but the whole group could tell he didn't really know what was going on, so he just kind of zoned out during all of our meetings.","We had 5 students, one was hard of hearing","Interpreters have a hard time when dealing with specific technical terms...so that was difficult","","6 weeks (a little over half a quarter).","We did both, in class would be better if we had had an interpreter.  A lot of times you can't get an interpreter for just one meeting with one Deaf student.","No -- I don't think the HoH student requested an interpreter for the class.",""
"DK-IRB DE Paper - Hearing Student-Hearing 1","09/23/2013 10:31 AM","2","Below Average","The language barrier causes the team to move at a slower pace because of translations.","I have only worked with one or two teams that had a deaf/HoH student. I did not enjoy the experience because having a 3rd party translator present for communication makes things awkward.","Documentation as almost all conversations were recorded electronically.","Understanding the deaf/HoH student when they spoke. To overcome the issue we were required to use the translator.","Four team members total, with two deaf/HoH.","The team could of had more patients while working with the deaf/HoH student and interpreter.","I've experienced working with an interpreter and notetaker and they both provided adequate services.","The teams I worked on were just for in class activities, nothing long term.","Meetings were only held in class.","We did have an interpreter and it was helpful. Though sometimes it was awkward communicating through a 3rd party.","Four students were typically on a team, with two dear/HoH. They typically will group two deaf/HoH students together, which makes things difficult as the team feels divided."
"DK-IRB DE Paper - Hearing Student-Hearing 1","09/23/2013 10:53 AM","4","Above Average","For several of my years working on campus at RIT, I was employed by NTID doing software engineering work with both hard of hearing and deaf clients.  I had to learn to communicate and bridge the language gap.  In addition, my manager was deaf and I had went out of my way to learn a little sign language in order to better understand him and the clients that we were working with.","2 to 3 teams.  I enjoyed it because it brought in a new perspective for the team to work with.  As a result, we were able to deliver high end products that met a larger scope of users.","Being able to understand a deaf/hard of hearing students mentality toward applications.  In their mentality, simple is often times the best option.  When an application becomes too overly complex or changes too drastically, it often takes them twice as long to re-learn the system as it does for a hearing student.","At first yes, but over time I slowly learned how to sign simple computer/technical terms that aided me when discussing implementations with them.","5 students.  1 or 2 were deaf/hard of hearing","Communication between team members could definitely have gone better.","Yes.  Both interpreters and note-takers have both been equally helpful when working with hard of hearing and deaf students.","Some projects were only a single quarter while there were others that spanned the course of a year.","Team meetings were held at the office and in class.  Outside of class we communicated through IM","No.","5.  I think that this is a perfect number for a team because anything more would have been too large.  This was a good amount for the developers to bounce information and work off of."
"DK-IRB DE Paper - Hearing Student-Hearing 1","09/23/2013 02:00 PM","1","Extremely Poor","The hard-of-hearing student that I worked with contributed nothing to our group project.","I have only worked on one team with a hard-of-hearing student and greatly disliked the experience. As I mentioned earlier, the student contributed nothing to the project and was ineffective at communication.","Nothing went well when working with the hard-of-hearing student.","Yes, face-to-face communication with the hard-of-hearing student was difficult. As a result, my team communicated via email whenever possible. However, this could not facilitate communication during meetings.","For the one team I worked with a hard-of-hearing student, there were four students including me and one was hard-of-hearing.","We needed more efficient communication. Face-to-face communication was essentially impossible, and we did not have access to an interpreter.","There was no interpreter for the class in which we worked with a hard-of-hearing student, even though I feel that one would have been beneficial.","The project went for the length of the term, but was a few weeks short. I would say the project ran for 5-7 weeks. The initial challenge for us as a team was trying to communicate with the hard of hearing student. After we found our attempts to communicate were ineffective, we faced the challenge of picking up the work that would have been completed by the hard-of-hearing student.","Our meetings were typically held out of class. It did not make a difference when the meetings were held, since the class did not have an interpreter.","No, we never had an interpreter at our meetings, although I feel that one would have been helpful.","Typically, teams are comprised of 3-5 students. Depending on the size of the project, this is a good number. The one team of 3 I was on felt too small, as a result of all other teams in the class being a size of 4. A group of 3-5 students is large enough where we can all be productive and not face too many different opinions, but not too small where we struggle to finish all the required work."
"DK-IRB DE Paper - Hearing Student-Hearing 1","09/23/2013 02:25 PM","2","Below Average","The increased difficulty in communication made it difficult to explain and assign work. Almost to the point where it was easier to just assign to someone else and not include the deaf student.","2 teams.<br><br>I did not mind the first experience. The student was hard of hearing, but could communicate with us clearly using a hearing aid and lip reading. <br><br>The second experience was significantly worse. The student could not communicate with us, so we ended up assigning her little to no work.","I have not experienced anything go particularly well when working with a deaf/hard of hearing student that a normal student could not do.","Yes. In my first experience, we had to speak louder and ensure we were facing the hard of hearing student whenever we spoke. This was not too difficult.<br><br>In my second experience, we had to use text chat to communicate with the team member. This made it very difficult to explain assignments and the work we needed done - the student ended up doing almost no work on the project. Thankfully, the course wasn't too difficult and it was possible to do it with a ""missing"" member.","4, 1","Meeting regularly at times where an interpreter was available","It seemed difficult to acquire an interpreter for the various meetings we held. Our meetings were often scheduled on short notice which made it difficult to acquire services.","Projects were always length of term. The challenges with respect to the project itself changed, the communication challenges we were faced with by the deaf/HH did not change.","Both. We preferred the out of class meetings, as it was difficult to sit through a lecture and then meet right after.","No. But when we did have an interpreter, they were very very helpful and the interactions were always positive.","4. This is a good number because if you have more, then you start running into challenges coordinating. If you have fewer, then you may not have enough help to do all the work."
"DK-IRB DE Paper - Hearing Student-Hearing 1","09/23/2013 03:30 PM","2","Below Average","It is very difficult when working on a team with a deaf/hh student not due to direct communication, but when an interpreter is involved.  This is because the speed of communication is slowed significantly due to the ability of the interpreter.  It is clearly frustrating for the deaf/hh student because the interpreter has to constantly clarify what they are interpreting.","I have worked on about 3 teams.  The experience was pleasant in that I know ASL and found it interesting to work on that type of team but frustrating due to the other students on the team not taking the time to talk individually at a pace that the interpreter could keep up with.","What went well is that they are just as capable as anyone else, and the fact that we are going at a slower pace allows for an actual full thought process to occur instead of trying to blaze through half thought out options.","The definite communication challenge was with those who didn't know ASL and had very weak communication skills which can happen quite often in our field.  Those students spoke quitely, mumbled, talked very fast, and talked over each other which is difficult to understand in general and made the interpreter need to have students repeat many many times.  Also when the deaf student had to speak it was hard for the interpreters to word the computer terminology in a manner that makes sense to a programmer.","The team size was about 5 students with 1 deaf or hh student.","If the interpreter was able to translate into the proper terminology it would have been much easier to work with.","I have experienced working on a team that had an interpreter, and though they were adequate they severely slowed conversation and was not able to word the terminology in a manner that made sense.","The project was about a week - 3 weeks.  The challenges did not change over the course of the project.","The meetings were mostly in class.  I would imagine they would not be different outside of class either.","The interpreter seemed frustrated by the speed and lack of communication skills that the group had.  They were helpful in that there stood no chance of any communication without her, but it was still not the same as having a team that didnt need an interpreter.","There were 5-7 students on my team and I believe this was a good number because the work could be divided equally and the team could be divided into aspects of the project and could meet separately."
"DK-IRB DE Paper - Hearing Student-Hearing 1","09/23/2013 08:31 PM","3","Average","The first experience I had working with deaf or hard of hearing students is with my current job with RIT in the Student IT Office.  The student I was working with was very smart, but at times it difficult to get my point across to the student, which sometime meant that I had to explain myself multiple times before he and I would be on the same page.  Overall the experience was not an average experience.","The only team I have ever worked on with a deaf/hard of hearing student was at my current job with the RIT Student IT Office.  I am still working there so it is an on-going experience.  As I said earlier, it was definitely noticeable that it was harder to get the student up to speed with the rest of the team but it was a good experience that opens your eyes to how different people can be.  Also, the kid is smart and funny which made the experience much more enjoyable.","After giving him a task to complete and after everything was fully explained to him, he was able to go off on his own and work extremely efficiently without much help at all.  This happened while we were working on new features being added to a web application.","The student I was working with was a hard of hearing student and there were definitely some communication challenges when working with him.  I had to repeat myself many times and in some instances had to explain it in different ways in order to get my point across.  There was no real way to overcome it, other than re-explain it or explain it in another way.","I'm usually on teams of about 4 or 5 students.  I have only been on one team that had one deaf/HH student.","The communication.  I wish there was someway to make it easier to help explain myself without having to explain it over and over again.","We never used an interpreter.","The team I am on with the hard of hearing student is for the entire Fall Semester.  No, the challenges didn't really change over the course of the project.","Since this was at our job, the meetings were not held in a class but in the work place.  I actually liked them being during work rather than outside of work.","There were no interpreters at our meetings.","4 to 5 students are typically on my teams.  This is a good number as if you get any higher number of students, then there is not enough work and communication breaks down, and if you go with less than this it becomes hard to get all of the work done."
"DK-IRB DE Paper - Hearing Student-Hearing 1","09/24/2013 09:48 PM","2","Below Average","There is a language barrier which prevent smooth in-person communication between team members. Deaf tend to be left out of conversations and ad-hoc decision making. The technology for smooth communication and interpreters are available ad-hoc and require extra planning. Typing is inefficient.<br><br>Little to no problems with hard-of-hearing team members that hear okay/relatively well.","Two (One not SE related). The experience is fine as a hearing student with most other members being hearing as well. But, I don't believe the experience is that well for deaf individuals.","Nothing out of the ordinary from the ""went wells"" of full hearing teams. However since there is extra attention on making sure good notes are written, notes tend to be more thorough.","Communication between the hearing and deaf is more difficult and slower due to the alternative forms that need to be used. Communication was done by typing questions and keeping real-time displayed notes.","3 - 5 people. 1 deaf/HH.","Having an interpreter present.","It seems as though the interpreting services requires the deaf individual to request them rather than other hearing members. Therefore, there services can't be well used if the deaf individual forgot to or chose not to request the interpreter.","One quarter. The challenges did change, the team just got used to them.","Mostly out of class but some in class as well. Out of class is preferred because the meeting is less time restricted and allows for preparation specifically for that meeting.","No. The interpreter wasn't requested due to the meetings being ad-hoc or the interpreter just not being requested by whatever responsible party.","My SE teams were mostly alway 4-5 people on average. Seems to be a good number with so many different parts to projects. But not too many members that individuals can't contribute."
