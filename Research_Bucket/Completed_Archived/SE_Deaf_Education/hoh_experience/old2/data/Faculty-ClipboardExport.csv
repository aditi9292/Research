"Survey-Response Set","Submitted","How many courses have you had deaf/hard of hearing students in?","Have the courses youÂ’ve had a deaf/hard of hearing student in typically had more than one deaf/hard of hearing student?

"DK-IRB DE Paper - Faculty-Faculty-DE-1","09/25/2013 06:31 PM","1","One in one class.","I felt that I could have prepared myself better by researching ahead of time the impact of a deaf or hard of hearing student on both the class and on his/her individual learning experience.","Oral lectures seem to go well, although I feel as though some of the individual personality or humor in what I say might not be getting through as well as it could.","Yes.  Interpreters, note takers, etc... although I may not be aware if the efforts were insufficient.","Be sure to include the students in group activities, etc.  Sometimes it can be hard to distinguish between barriers or issues caused by the disability and individual personality traits of the student.","I would spend some time individually with the student.  The 'getting to know each other' part of the first class was a bit awkward.","There seems to be a hesitation or something similar in joining with others for group work.  The first part of my class involves a measured amount of group work, with intentional mixing of students to allow final group choices to be better made/","I have not used any resources with the exception of occasionally reviewing the posted notes from my class lectures for accuracy and improvement of future classes."
"DK-IRB DE Paper - Faculty-Faculty-DE-1","09/26/2013 09:44 AM","If you mean courses 4, if you want to include sections then 5 (I had a student in 2 different classes)","No, just 1","Yes, as a good presentation was conducted at my faculty orientation by NTID and I am also otherwise familiar with inclusive teaching practices.","Most of the students used interpreters, though 1 did not and 1 did in certain circumstances (group work/presentations).  This worked well as long as the student actually paid attention (1 student in particular often was either late, sleeping, not coming to class or doing other things on the computer).  Some students have the ability to read lips so as long as the speaker faced them, it worked well for them.  In some group settings (not all of the time) chat was used to get some information across such as certain updates or annotating a diagram.  This is more when the student was in a team.  I used interpreters in class, shared slides beforehand, and made sure that used mycourses and the whiteboard to reinforce spoken announcements. Also, any videos I have used are closed captioned.","Yes, as long as the students pay attention (see note above) and in the cases of out of classroom reserve interpreters in a timely manner.  Some students do get a delay in times for the notes taken in class by a note taker, but it is not a matter of having one but possibly some process afterwards (not sure).","Pay attention to the NTID presentation at orientation.  Have the same expectations of D/HH students as you would anyone else.  If extra time is needed on tests, follow that procedure (or any other accommodations listed).  CC any videos used.  Don't speak to the board when lecturing, your other students will appreciate it too.  Also, don't look at the interpreter when the D/HH student is speaking.","Nothing, as I am doing what needs to be done.","For the most part, the 3 of the 4 students participated in class, activities, and their team just fine (including leadership roles for some).  One student who I had in 2 classes, was late or missed class (not always informed his interpreters), did not pay attention in class or slept through parts of it, etc.  But that was not due to being D/HH as any student can be careless regardless of any disability.","Me personally, I have not used any resources other than the initial presentation."
"DK-IRB DE Paper - Faculty-Faculty-DE-1","09/26/2013 10:28 AM","approx 5","none","I feel more comfortable now. It took a bit of adjustment just to procure communication. As for preparation I did not have any formal training. Other colleagues and my reaching out to NTID helped understand what things I can do to help.","Interpreter.<br>Written curriculum/syllabus/course materials.<br>Email.","Yes.<br>I am however unclear as to the level of support for teamwork that takes place outside of class in which I do not participate.","Perhaps a summary sheet/card with TOP 10 tools/techniques that can be handed to a professor and/or fellow students to guide the interactions/communication with the deaf/hard of hearing students.","As members of the community within my class they are treated equally and accommodations are made when necessary.  <br><br>Perhaps learning ASL would help them feel more welcomed but I don't posses the skill or have the commitment to become fully proficient and take the role of interpreting.","For the most part I find it is all working OK. Periods right after class when questions may arise between the student and his/her peers or for the Professor and the interpreter has left make it for an awkward often challenging exchange.<br><br>Perhaps not pertinent to this study but to mention an analogous scenario with a different physical challenge. I have a blind student in a my class:<br>Writing/Drawing on the White Board is a technique that is used a lot by instructor and peers alike. It is used to compliment the concepts or conduct student activities. With the limited time on 50 minute format it has become a real challenge to ""read out loud or describe"" all that is on the board.","Interpreting<br>Was going to use close caption but found it possible to play a video that had already been captioned.<br><br>Perhaps there are other services/resources available that I may not have considered or know about..."
"DK-IRB DE Paper - Faculty-Faculty-DE-1","09/26/2013 05:24 PM","3","Usually 1 student","Yes, mostly. The interpreters I've had are professional and easy to work with. They've given me some feedback on keeping my lectures easy to interpret. It also helps that Kelley (Grad SE) can read lips quite well.","Just talking to her directly. I don't notice that much of a difference after a while.","As far as I can see, yes.","Don't worry about speaking too fast - the interpreters generally keep up well. Don't use a lot of pronouns based your pointing in your lectures (e.g. don't say ""as you see here"", say ""as you see in the UML class diagram"").","I usually try to talk with the interpreters to make sure everything is okay, and they usually are. Sometimes I will ask the interpreters if they are picking up the terminology okay, and they'll usually ask for some references to look up words.","Class discussions can be more of a challenge because of people talking all at once sometimes. But mostly, it's a pretty seamless experience.","I have not, and haven't really had the need to."
"DK-IRB DE Paper - Faculty-Faculty-DE-1","09/26/2013 05:45 PM","1","No","Not in the beginning for the first instance, there was a short learning curve on logistics and student expectations.","The majority of communication was through the interpreter.","Yes","Ideally, get some training on how to best interact with a deaf student. ASL capability is ideal but not realistic for all to master.","I would work harder at facing the deaf student during lecture.","Project team interactions provide the most challenge, although in my experience the team with the deaf student was tolerant and performed normally.","No, beyond interpreters."
"DK-IRB DE Paper - Faculty-Faculty-DE-1","10/07/2013 02:16 PM","10","Only one course had more than one. That class had two deaf/hh students in it.","Knowing ASL would help, but short of that, I am probably as well prepared as I can be.","The use of an interpreter was certainly good. For office hours, we worked with written or typed communication.","Inside of class is OK. Our courses all require a significant amount of outside class meeting with project teams. For that the student is mostly on their own.","","I probably should try to talk slowly to make the interpreter's job easier.","Communication outside of the classroom setting has been difficult.","RIT/NTID provides good resources. I have worked well with any interpreters who are in my course. I have not taken advantage of other resources that might be available."
