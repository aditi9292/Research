\todo{update based on our findings}
In this work, we demonstrated our technique of downloading and analyzing \hl{68,513} Android applications in a variety of areas including security vulnerability level, overprivileges, code clones, potential defects, and coding standards mistakes. We found that, on average, Android applications increase in their potential security risks with each release while increase instances of code clones and decreasing potential defects. We conducted our analysis within genres and found that certain genres included more instances of overprivileges. As a control, we compared our analysis results against known malware and found that the static analysis tools we employed demonstrated high levels of security risk where malware was known. These results provide a broad overview of the state of the breadth of free apps in the Google Play store.
