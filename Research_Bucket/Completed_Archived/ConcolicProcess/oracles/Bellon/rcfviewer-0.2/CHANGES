  rcfviewer Changes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.2:
  - New Features & Improvements:
    - Similar Files View: The computation of the similar files is faster now.
      Changing between file pairs in the view is also faster.
    - Most of the transformations from other formats to RCF can be executed
      from the viewer now.
    - Browsing the RCF data: When a relation is displayed via the 'Show
      Relation...' menu option, it is possilble to follow references. To do
      so, hold the control key and click on a reference. (issue #198)
    - For incremental detection iclones requires a directory that contains
      one subdirectory for each version of the analyzed source code. These
      directories do not need to contain all files, but only those that changed.
      Like cyclone, the rcfviewer will now search missing files in the previous
      versions. (issue #227)
  - Bug fixes:
    - The batch file to start rcfviewer on windows systems has been fixed.
    - Fixed some scrolling issues in different components. (issue #192)
    - On some Windows installations the viewer did not restore after it
      was minimized. (issue #232)

Version 0.1:
  initial relase
  Known issues:
    - Similar Files view is slow in some cases.
    - Code highlighting sometimes fails on older RCF files that do not
      contain chracter offset information. "Style Failure" will be reported
      on the console.
