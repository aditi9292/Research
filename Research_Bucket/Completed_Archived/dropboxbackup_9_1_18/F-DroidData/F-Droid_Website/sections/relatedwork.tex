While we are unaware of any projects which have gathered such a substantial amount of Android data, performed various types of static analysis upon it, and made is as publicly available as we did, there are several existing commercial websites which do provide metics about Android applications. Appannie~\cite{appAnnie_url}, AppBrain~\cite{appbrain_url}, and AppZoom~\cite{appzoom_url} contain analytical and statistical information about hundreds of thousands of Android apps in a  robust and easy to use online format. They do not appear to make their data fully transparent or examine the version histories as we have done.

A large number of previous works have analyzed version control systems for various software engineering purposes. Eyolfson et al.\cite{Eyolfson:2011:TDD:1985441.1985464} examined the effects that developer experience, and date and time of commit had on the bugginess of an application. Buse and Weimer\cite{Buse:2010:ADP:1858996.1859005} used commit messages to automatically document program changes. While we do not perform any data analysis in this paper, the previous use of version control information for software engineering research demonstrates the importance and relevance of our dataset.
