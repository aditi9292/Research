Mobile applications~(\emph{apps}) are ubiquitous in today's world, allowing us to do everything from update our Facebook profile to trading of stocks at the push of a button. Unfortunately, with this great power also comes extreme dangers. User's may unknowingly download a malicious application, while developer's may create an app with security vulnerabilities which may lead to a range of security threats ranging from data theft to device locking. Recent studies have shown that 68-77\% of Android apps are susceptible to just a single SSL vulnerability.
This article present an easy to use, publicly available website and data set located to assist developers, researchers, users and educators/students with better understanding Android app security. The underlying infrastructure contains a number of security and static analysis tools which are automatically run over one thousands open source Android apps from the F-Droid repository. The Androsec portal represents the apps source code, the security scores, and analyzed results from various tools and provides several features for the users to query this analytical dataset.

%Developers must not only be aware of both how to create secure apps, but of the importance of developing secure apps as well. Conversely, user's should have quality, easily accessible information to enable them to make an informed, objective decision about which apps and app versions off the best level of security. Researchers pave the way for new discoveries in both the process of developing secure software, and in understanding why vulnerabilities take place at a technical level. In order to carry out both qualitative and quantitative studies, researchers need quality and accessible data sets in which to analyze. Students need quality data, examples and exercises to educate them about the importance and process of creating secure apps.

%We have created an easy to use, publicly available website an data set located at~\url{http://androsec.rit.edu} to assist developers, researchers, users and educators/students with better understanding Android app security,. We created this by first downloading 1,179 open source Android apps from the F-Droid repository, which we then analyzed using several security and quality static analysis tools. The site contains both comprehensive and easy to use reports, along with several in-depth data sets for researchers to download. \dan{Should this be shortened?}
