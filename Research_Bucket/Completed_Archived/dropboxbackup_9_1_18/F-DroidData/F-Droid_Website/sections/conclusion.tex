We have presently our publicly accessible website (\textbf{http://androsec.rit.edu}) for use by students, instructors, developers, researchers and Android app users. We have described how the data set was created, its possible uses, and examples of how to use the website. We hope that our work assists in the education, discovery and understanding of Android vulnerabilities and why they occur.
