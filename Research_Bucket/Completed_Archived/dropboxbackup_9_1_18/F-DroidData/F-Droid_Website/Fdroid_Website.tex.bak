\textbf{Project Summary:} Through this project, a group of faculty from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and Park University will collaborate to produce a set of educational mobile exercises, which may be used in the curriculum at not only these schools, but importantly at other institutions as well. Park University is also in the process of creating security and mobile courses, so this collaborative effort will also serve to foster an interactive effort between the two institutions and assist Park in these endeavors.


In addition to fostering collaboration between these two institutions, our primary goal is to continue the development of publicly available online modules for University students and developers in order to teach them about how to create secure mobile applications, and the  importance of creating secure mobile apps. Students and new developers frequently create mobile applications (apps) as a way to learn basic programming skills, and to even earn extra money. Demonstrating proper security techniques in mobile development is a great way to intrigue new developers. Institutions have come to take notice of the importance of security in the curriculum. Unfortunately, many institutions are ill-equipped to create useful and meaningful examples which demonstrate how to create secure mobile software.


Our existing project includes ten Android modules and we would like to continue the creation of our educational modules and expand them to include a more diverse set of vulnerabilities, along with create examples in iOS. Our current set of examples include topics ranging from Intent Protection to how to protect apps transmitting data over HTTP. Each activity will also contain a set of instructor slides which may be used to lecture about the vulnerability, associated readings, and a Youtube video which will both discuss the specific vulnerability in the app, but also lead the student through removing the vulnerability. This three year project will include module development using using commonly occurring, problematic, and interesting vulnerabilities as guides.


The program will be piloted to Rochester and Kansas City students focusing on economically disadvantaged and underrepresented groups. The goal of these activities will not only be to receive feedback on the modules, but will importantly serve to educate these students about the importance of software security and foster their interested on this topic. We will perform a formative assessment throughout the development process and summative assessment will be used to study the effectiveness of the program. All initial materials may be found on the project website: \url{www.TeachingMobileSecurity.com}

\textbf{Teaching Security Through Examples: A Publicly Available Set of Vulnerable Mobile Apps}
\vspace{3mm}

%News headlines discussing data breeches and stolen information has unfortunately become commonplace.

The mobile revolution has altered the face of computing allowing users to perform actions which were not previously possible. With this great power comes great dangers as mobile intrusions may be more dangerous than conventional software vulnerabilities as the mobile devices we use on a daily basis serve as a more intimate portal to our daily lives. Mobile vulnerabilities have have affected individuals, businesses and even nation states. They frequently store data ranging from personal family phones and banking information, to the ability to track a user's location at any time. These intrusions have led to an increased research and educational emphasis in creating secure software. Unfortunately, creating secure software is difficult. Teaching how to create secure software can be an even more difficult task. Instructors frequently lack the time, resources, or knowledge to create robust, real world examples and instructional sessions about how to most properly teach the creation of secure mobile apps. This project will equip instructors with the proper tools to help their students learn about properly developing secure mobile apps, and will also serve to demonstrate the importance of security to students creating mobile apps. Students will see the real world nature of mobile vulnerabilities and how the idea of software security isn't merely meant for security experts, but is a topic which all developers; both novice and experienced should pat attention to.

Creating secure software is arguably one of the most significant computing challenges students face today. It is no longer enough to create software on time, on budget, and that is high quality. Security is a paramount concern that needs to be considered at every faucet of the software development lifecycle. Unfortunately, instructors of mobile and security courses far too often lack the resources to properly integrate these activities into their classroom. One of these many institutions is Park University in Missouri who is struggling with adding these elements into their curriculum.

%%% Drop in some industry experience.

\noindent
\textbf{Deficiencies With Current Educational Techniques: }

 %A survey of XXX security courses found that only XXX\% of these offered security components. \todo{finish}

While the concept of software security has become an increasingly popular topic in not only the real world, but in the classroom; it is unfortunately not adequately covered in the classroom. Even worse, it is frequently left out of the educational process all together. Although larger institutions frequently have the resources to devote entire courses or even programs to security, many small institutions do not have the resources to do this. This is problematic since the students taking these courses will not be exposed to the imperative security concepts which they will need to properly create security mobile software. \todo{finish}


%% Add this part in about why schools say that they would uses the activities that I am creating

% Students (especially under represented students) are not exposed to or motivated about security (find citation to back this up)

%There are innumerable courses in either security or mobile development at all levels of education and security has increasingly become a wider focal point.


After speaking with instructors of mobile development at other institutions

% There are XXXX courses in creating mobile software, but only X courses in creating secure mobile software
% Do a survey of courses, especially at the liberal arts level and see how many include a security component
% Are there any facts to show that educators need these types of activities

We have brought together a team of experienced researchers with a who are experienced working with security in an industrial and academic settings. Our team is also experienced with pedagogical research in computing education as well. We expect that this will allow us to create a robust set of activities which will meet the primary project objectives.

\noindent
\textbf{Approach and Methodology: }
In order to make easy to use activities which will foster the inclusion of security in the classroom and cultivate student interest in the topic, we will continue the creation of our educational vulnerability modules. Each module will adhere to a specific template in order to ensure continuity between the activities make the adoption process of these modules as easy as possible for instructors. These modules will focus on important, relevant security concepts in mobile development and will include a comprehensive instructor's guide. Each module will contain the following:




%%% Being able to find vulnerabilities is very important, so we are including steps to discover vulnerabilities in systems


\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{.8pt}

  \item A process to demonstrate that the vulnerability has been removed
  \item Real world examples of the vulnerability in the wild.
  \item A Youtube video clearly demonstrating how to conduct the activity.
  \item A Youtube video providing a short lecture on the activity.
  \item XXX
  \item XXX

    %% Other steps to add in?



\end{itemize}

%% Mention how these modules differ from existing works out there
%%  What data they collect. Who they are oriented for

Our Senior Personnel consultants will provide guidance on selecting the appropriate vulnerabilities to include in our activities, and will also review all created materials for accuracy.

The modules will be primarily intended for undergraduate college students, but should fit into a wide range of curriculum including upper level high school and graduate level classes. In order to accommodate a diverse set of classrooms and skill sets, the activities will range from simple examples geared toward novice level developers and security students in order to demonstrate basic security concepts; all the way to advanced topics intended to educate and motivate even the most experienced developers. Each module is intended to captivate student attention by clearly demonstrating the targeted vulnerability.

Each module will contain a brief (approximately 10-15 minute) Youtube video providing appropriate background about the vulnerability along with demonstrating how to conduct the activity. The primary motivation for the videos are to assist in flipped classroom settings, help in providing instructors on the necessary information about each vulnerability, and provide an educational mechanism for students who may be working through the modules on their own with no instructor support.

The modules will be freely available on the project website, with each module containing the necessary material to conduct each activity. Additional instructor resources, such as lecture slides will require teachers to register online to receive this information for free. A primary reason for requiring this registration process is to record...\todo{What information to collect?} . Through this registration process, instructors will also receive answer keys to the post exercise questionnaires. Instructors will also be able to make requests for future course modules.

%%% How to record information from instructors at the conclusion of activity. How can we use this information to assist with evaluating the learning objectives? What research will we be doing based off this data.

Each of the modules will be stand-alone so that instructors can choose only the most appropriate exercises for their classrooms. With the increasingly large demands placed on teachers, providing them this extra flexibility to choose the modules that they would like to use is paramount. We believe that extra restrictions placed on instructors would likely lead to less widespread adoption. Our goal is to provide resources for instructors, but not restrict them to teach in their desired manner. %%% How to show that the module has been completed

Although all project material will be available to download and use individually, when possible we will also provide all activities on a downloadable Virtual Machine (VM) to make the set up and configuration process as easy as possible for the user. Unfortunately, due to platform constraints we will only be able to create this VM for Android examples.

In order to guide the creation of appropriate and robust vulnerability examples, we will use several inputs including: (I) Prevalent mobile vulnerabilities which will be found from a variety of sources including examining CVE databases, and other resources on the web (II) Instructor requests through the online project mechanism (III) Interesting vulnerability examples to spark user interest. Whenever possible, real world examples will be discussed to reinforce the relevance of the vulnerability. Our selection of activities and quality control will be guided by our Senior Personnel advisors.



\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
\textbf{Pedagogy: } Our project will use an active learning pedagogy. Research indicates that active learning promotes student retention and increases student performance while further motivating the students in comparison with conventional educational techniques~\cite{24821756, bonwell1991active}. Research has also demonstrated active learning to be beneficial in security courses, especially when students are provided hands on, real world examples of the covered topics~\cite{conklin2006cyber, 4755793}.

While active learning classrooms have demonstrated numerous benefits, especially in security education, they are frequently much more difficult to implement as opposed to conventional lecture driven classes. Instructors frequently struggle with creating active learning environments due to the lacking the necessary resources required to develop or purchase supporting materials for these classroom activities~\cite{4755793}.




% RQ: Does adding components like this to courses have an effect on: Increasing student interest/diversity in these topics?
%		- Are institutions more likely to offer courses in these areas if they are provided activities such as this



%    One advantage of welldesigned active learning activities is that they may be more motivational to students and thus hold student attention longer than lecturing alone bonwell1991active

Thus far, we have already created over ten Android modules which are publicly available on our project website. These modules do not contain many of the proposed materials such as videos, or course lecture slides. Through this project, we will work with students and other institutions to create relevant modules which may be used to best serve appropriate educational objectives. A primary objective of our work is to create relevant, real world vulnerability examples. In order to guide our selection of activities, we will continue to use websites such as the Android and iOS developer guides, and the CVE database to ensure the relevance of our activities. Below are a group of proposed modules including the vulnerabilities and educational objectives which they address.

Modules will be created in small groups and will be added to the project website to be made publicly available as they are created. We anticipate our first modules being made available in less than four months after the beginning of the project. Our data collection and analysis portion will also begin as soon as modules are used in courses, which we anticipate will be within one year after the beginning of the project. Although project work will be conducted over the course of the school year, most efforts will be primarily made over the summer months by students and faculty.


In order to appropriately describe our created modules, we will next demonstrate one of our already created modules, which is available on the project website.

\textbf{Diversity} Diversity is a priority at the Rochester Institute of Technology and Park University. The instituions have numerous groups dedicated to supporting the diversity of the student body, and assisting the inclusion of under represented students. Some of these groups include Women in Computing (Wic)\footnote{\url{http://wic.rit.edu/}}, Women in Science (WISe)\footnote{\url{http://www.rit.edu/science/wise}}, Women in Engineering (WE \@ RIT)\footnote{\url{https://www.rit.edu/kgcoe/women/}} and Global Union\footnote{\url{https://thelink.rit.edu/organization/global_union}}. RIT is also home to the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID)\footnote{\url{http://www.ntid.rit.edu/}} which is the nation's leading technical institute serving those who are both Deaf and Hard of Hearing. A primary project goal is how the created artifacts may increase student interest and retention, especially in institutions which historically serve underrepresented students who would not otherwise have the resources to conduct these activities in their courses.
