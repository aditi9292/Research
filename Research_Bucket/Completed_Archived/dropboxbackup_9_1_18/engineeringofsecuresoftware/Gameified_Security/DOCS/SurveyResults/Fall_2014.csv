Therefore, the end of the term was the appropriate time to do this activity.","It allowed me to learn about security resources while still having fun.","Maybe we could have been given more preparation (such as giving us the sheets the class period beforehand to better understand the game). However part of the fun was learning it on the fly, so I don't have any real complaints.","Learned to balance security resources, and see how they're all interconnected.","Nothing really, just make sure the numbers on the spreadsheet and paper copy match up.","Nope"

Things happen and if you are not prepared with security it in mind, these days it can be catastrophic.","The spreadsheet and rules were still a little unclear until mid-way in the game and the inaccuracy of the spreadsheets.","That a 'hacker mindset' is always a good mindset, and that its an entire companies ideology that'll make the software safe, not just a team's responsibility or a persons responsibility.","- Clearer starting instructions (goal, expectations, points etc.)a, which yields to more time for the activity.<br>- Correct spreadsheets","I think that a lot of the best ideas that came into play came from outside experience and not directly from the class. For example focusing a lot on CI is important, but that wasn't really part of the security course. Same goes with many of the possible actions -> they involved a lot of previous knowledge of what it was. Now this is good and bad. Good because it teaches those who don't know what it is, but bad because that's probably not where they should be learning the stuff. Its a difficult problem to solve.<br><br>Another way of putting it is that its simulating the real world so much (in a good way) that those who haven't been or experienced the real world may not have found the activity as impact-ful. <br><br>Either way amazing epic activity, 10/10."
