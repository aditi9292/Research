It would be really cool if the entire thing was online.

At the end, when we know most of the concepts pretty well, was a good spot.","It was interesting to try to predict what types of vulnerabilities would come up and how our choices might help mitigate them.","It seemed unbalanced in terms of which departments were able to mitigate which vulnerabilities. Some were big in month 1, then had very little impact until month 5 (which didn't really matter since events happen after the month).","Manipulate the work to gain more effective resources.","The distribution of vulnerabilities in each month and mitigations in each month should be a little more even across the teams. Some more automated testing should be added as well (I've been at companies that ran 100s of automated tests every 6 hours, unit tests, integration tests and static analysis).","I really like the concept, it just needs more refinement before it is fully balanced."

It was very engaging. It definitely can't be done unless all the course topics have been covered.","It was fun! Made you think about how real world events affect software security. Also that first month was critical for our team to get everything set up.","Teams were too big. The front page was kind of a mess (flow chart).","SSL > Crypto lol and that Software Security is expensive.","Make it obvious which activities are repeatable on the front page by adding a repeatable symbol to them. Organize the flow chart better. Categorize things and put them in their own containers. It can help visualize and organize the data. The numbers of objects should go in order so that when I'm looking for object 1 its always at the top left hand corner of the flowchart.","As a board gamer I appreciated this activity. I think the packet could be organized a bit better, especially the flowchart, and the teams can be smaller, but other than that it was a great way to end the year."

I could seriously see myself playing this in my own free time.","I didn't expect the time management to be so difficult.

It did not actually take so long to decide what security features to implement. After the first ""round"" we understood the game well enough to decide pretty quickly.","There are trade-offs between implementing security features and actually completing primary development work. Certain security features and protections apply more to certain teams/domains than others.","It would be really cool if somebody implemented the game as a web app or something like that.","I thought it was great.
