- Look @ RQs on pg 4 of "Reevaluating Android Permission Gaps with Static and Dynamic Analysis" (2015)
	- Analyze:
		- Does our approach detect more overprivs than previous approaches?
		- How many apps are permission overprived?
		- What are the most pervasive overprivs in Android M apps
		- Explore the reasons why they are overprived? Why did this occur?






**** Other thoughts ****
- Maybe look at some F-droid apps which are now M to see how they evolve
	- Build a search tool to look through the Android M apps
- Compare pre and post M apps from Google Play. How do they differ in their permissions? Did they remove any?
- 

**** Other thoughts ****

-  If our tool doesnt get accepted, I think we pretty much need to get PScout working



**** General M Perm Study ****
- What mistakes do developers make when switching to Mperm
- What types of rationales do they provide?
- When do they provide rationales?
- Does switching to M affect an app's rating?
-
