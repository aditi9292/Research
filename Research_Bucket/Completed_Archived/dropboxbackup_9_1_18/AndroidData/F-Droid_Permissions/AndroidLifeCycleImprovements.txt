*********** More areas to explore***********

- What is the adoption rate of M?
- How do the number of permissions change when developers switch to M?
- 
- What changes to the source code occur with M?
- Do apps with more frequent permission changes (maybe compared to overall changes) have better user reviews?
- Who is adding vulnerabilities to the apps? Use a static anlaysis tool to locate vulnerabilities and see who is adding them to the apps
- Do a short developer interview to find out why this is and if it is a problem (Hussein)
- Are users complaining about the permissions in their reviews? (how many reviews talk about permissions anyways)
- Do apps with different commit ratios have other problems?
- Are M permissions being properly added? Who is adding them?
- Is there another way to evaluate the statistics in the paper? What could Pradeep help with? Maybe I am missing a story with this information.
- Just change to be a paper about permissions in open source Android apps?
- Who is adding changes to make things leak?
- Get the number of apps which are M. Can we detect overprivs in these apps? Who created them? (Introduce MPerm as a benefit of the paper)
-	I won't have the APKs for this task, but does it matter? I think I just need the source.
- 	I think the tool is going to have problems with the app's source code. The tool either needs to be fixed, or another tool needs to be chosen.



***** So what???
- 


***** ???
- Can we get the daily rating of an app?
- How many M apps are actually switched over to M




**** What permissions related problems occur in Apps? What are some tools I could use? ****
- How could I do a good comparision for overprivs and 
-		How many the apps fall in this version range?
-	Maybe it is best to just wait 





******* Actions **** 
- Do a fresh pull of the repos. 
- Is there another opriv analysis tool we can run on the apps? Find one, and run it.
- What other problems can permissions have? How can we measure permission effectivness?
- What are some other works out there? What am I contradicting/backing up with this work?




******** What Can I learn from Marshmallow conversions
-	Does it affect user ratings?
-		Might be a problem since it is impossible to tell if users are actually using m... Maybe not.. check Google Play
- What mistakes are users making? How often are they using rationale?
- Are permissions being removed? Does it look like developers are re-evaluating the permisisons their apps use?
-
