- What questions w


Mei- 
- Collcting permissions
- How are you collecting ratings? Avg or stars?



**************
- How many app versions do I actually have?
- Has this work been done before?
- Is it useful?




****************

- Find apps with atleast X versions

- Get the risk rating of each version of the app (Use taint)
- Do permissions grow?
- Do permissions related commit messages change with each version?
- How often are permissions removed from apps/check overprivs
- How often do developers make comments about ads?
- How is the quality of an app affected by the number of committers?
- 



- For most apps, we don't actually pull in the actual APKs. For most, we only have 3?
-	Could we do something with this?
-	Average low, middle, high permission values?


- 


****************
- App Manifest info
50=57
100=25
150=16
200=8


? What do other papers say about commit messages?

- Maybe just check to see if the permission changes. What does having the commit messages actually tell us? They could be wrong....

	select cfv.AppID as AppID, cfv.commitID as CommitID, cfv.percentCommitter  from PermissionChange_FrequencyBase_view cfv
	group by cfv.appID, cfv.commitID



	- Look at growth compared to last commit. 
	- These are only growth in permissions, not the actual permissions which are different. 
	- Need to come up with a count for this.

- Count the number of adds and removes for each commit. Find the 
- During the lifecycle of an app, look at ownership commits
