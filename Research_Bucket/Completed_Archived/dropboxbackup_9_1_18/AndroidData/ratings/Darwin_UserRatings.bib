	repository mining. Unlike other software repositories traditionally
	used in MSR work, app stores usually do not provide source code.
	However, they do provide a wealth of other information in the form
	of pricing and customer reviews. Therefore, we use data mining to
	extract feature information, which we then combine with more readily
	available information to analyse apps' technical, customer and business
	aspects. We applied our approach to the 32,108 non-zero priced apps
	available in the Blackberry app store in September 2011. Our results
	show that there is a strong correlation between customer rating and
	the rank of app downloads, though perhaps surprisingly, there is
	no correlation between price and downloads, nor between price and
	rating. More importantly, we show that these correlation findings
	carry over to (and are even occasionally enhanced within) the space
	of data mined app features, providing evidence that our `App store
	MSR' approach can be valuable to app developers.},
