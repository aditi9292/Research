%We next compared malicious copies of several applications as identified by the Contagio Mobile Mini Dump. In order to ensure that we were getting a like comparison, we found the benign version of the application and compared it with the same version of the malicious application. The first application we compared was a game,~\emph{CoinPirates} 1.0.6~\cite{CoinPirate_URL}. Each were each signed by different developers which is a further indication that the application was repackaged~\cite{Zhou:2012:DRS:2133601.2133640} \dan{? mention this}. The malicious version of the application asks for extra permissions upon installation and sends sensitive user information to a central location~\cite{CoinPirateReport_url}.

%The Fuzz Risk for the two versions were nearly identical, with both having the identical number of coding standards mistakes and number of code clones. The malicious version of the application had 3 more defects identified by JLint, and 4 over-permissions, which were \emph{android.permission.WRITE\_SMS}, \emph{android.permission.WRITE\_APN\_SETTINGS}, \emph{com.android.browser.permission.READ\_HISTORY\_BOOKMARKS}, \emph{com.android.browser.permission.WRITE\_HISTORY\_BOOKMARKS}. These extra permissions are used to gather information from the user, and then send this information to a central location. \todo{clean up formatting of these permssions}


%This further demonstrates how over permissions may be a serious security flaw, but also shows how a duplicated application candidate may be detected using various reverse engineered information about the application.
