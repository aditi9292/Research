<p>Android is currently the most popular mobile operating system in the world, with a myriad of applications (&ldquo;apps&rdquo;) freely available to users. As with most software, Android apps can put users at risk with inadvertent defects and vulnerabilities, even intentionally-placed malware. App stores typically mitigate these risks by moderating app reviews and managing the deployment of new releases. As a result, Android users may arrive at the belief that by upgrading their apps, they are installing a more stable and secure product. In this research, we investigate the maturity of mobile applications and their relationship with quality and security by statically analyzing Android applications. We collected and reverse engineered 30,020 Android applications from the GooglePlay store and analyzed each app using six static analysis tools. We examined maturity (via release number), application size, rate of potential defects, adherence to coding standards, rate of overprivileged settings, privileges used, potential vulnerability level, and number of code clones. We compared measurements between benign and known malware applications. Among our results were that Android applications degrade over time in potential vulnerabilities and overprivileged settings. We have publicly released our result set for transparency.<br />

<p>\section{Introduction}</p>
<p>% Get market share information from FlowDroid paper</p>
<p>% Use stats from <a href="http://www.androlib.com/appstats.aspx">http://www.androlib.com/appstats.aspx</a><br />
%There are over 1,300,000 Android applications~(\emph{apps}) with thousands of new applications being created every month~\cite{appbrain_stats_url}.</p>
<p>Android users download more than 1.5 billion applications~(&ldquo;apps&rdquo;) from GooglePlay every month~\cite{androidpopularity_url}. Apps are a major part of mobile consumer technology and have changed the computing experience of our modern digital society, allowing users to perform a variety of tasks not previously possible in a portable environment.</p>
<p>Software, mobile or not, is in need of constant maintenance. Android apps often contain inadvertant defects and vulnerabilities that can seriously impact a mobile user. Even worse, malicious developers regularly create malware apps to attack trusting Android users. App stores such as GooglePlay mitigate these risks by managing the delivery of app updates and moderating review systems so that users can make safe choices in what they install on their devices.  As a result, apps are routinely updated for bug fixes, vulnerability mitigations\dan{is mitigations an actual word?}, support for new hardware, and feature additions.</p>
<p>With a constant stream of updates, however, users may have develop the perception that their favorite apps are improving as the app is maturing. Between releases, developers have the opportunity to refactor, redesign, respond to reviews, and improve the product overall. However, as an app gains users, the size and complexity of the code base can also become unwieldy, leading to a regression of quality and security.</p>
<p>For developers, static analysis tools are one way of identifying potential risks of defects or vulnerabilities. Modern static analysis tools have been adapted to specific platforms, such as Android, to examine risks in areas such as overprivileges, unnecessary intents, and potential defects. In recent academic studies~\cite{Felt:2011:APD:2046707.2046779,Vidas11curbingandroid,Lee_2013}, static analysis tools have also been used as one method of measuring quality and security of mobile software. Thus, an empirical analysis of a large body of Android applications over time can provide a broad view into what ``improvements&rsquo;&lsquo; users are seeing as their apps are continually updated.</p>
<p>\emph{The goal of this work is to provide a overall understanding of the relationship between the maturity of mobile applications with potential quality and security defects.} We collected and reverse engineered 30,020 Android applications in 41 different genres from the GooglePlay store. We analyzed each of the apps using six static analysis tools: Stowaway~\cite{Felt:2011:APD:2046707.2046779}, AndroRisk~\cite{androguard_url}, CheckStyle~\cite{checkstyle_key}, JLint~\cite{jlint_key}, Simcad~\cite{6613857}, and APKParser~\cite{apkparser_link}.  We examined maturity (via the release number), application size, rate of potential defects, adherence to coding standards, rate of overprivileged settings, permissions used, potential vulnerability level, and number of code clones. We also compared our measurements between benign and known malware applications. Finally, we examined the relationship between our quality metrics and security metrics.</p>
<p>The contributions of this work are:</p>
<p>\begin{itemize}<br />
  \item An empirical analysis of how potential defects and vulnerabilities evolve over time in Android applications; and<br />
  \item A public data set of our results for future analysis by other researchers<br />
\end{itemize}</p>
<p>\section {Research Questions}<br />
This research is guided by the following questions. More details on how we collected our data can be found in Section~\ref{sec: collection}, and details on how we analyzed these metrics can be found in Section~\ref{sec: analysis}.</p>
<p>\textbf{RQ1:}~\emph{Does the number of potential security risks increase over time?}\<br />
We explore if applications increase or decrease in their potential security risks. The security risks we examine are overprivileges and identification of common security mistakes are discussed in Section~\ref{sec: evaluation}.</p>
<p>We perform this analysis with Stowaway to measure overprivileges and Androrisk to measure an application&rsquo;s risk. SeeSection~\ref{sec: analysis} for more details on these metrics.</p>
<p>\textbf{RQ2:}~\emph{What are the most pervasive overprivileges?}\<br />
Defining overly broad permissions for an Android app is a simple mistake that can lead to security issues arising in the future. We measured the number and types of overprivileges across our data set to examine the most common mistakes.</p>
<p>\textbf{RQ3:}~\emph{What is the variation of risks across genres?}\<br />
Different types of apps may lend themselves to different kinds of maturity, feature evolution, or security risks. We evaluate our results within GooglePlay genres.</p>
<p>\textbf{RQ4:}~\emph{Are benign apps measured as more secure when compared against known malware?}\<br />
To investigate the soundness of the static analysis tools and our measurements, we compare our measurements against a population of known malware. We examine the same risks as we did in RQ1.</p>

\section{Android Applications}</p>
<p>The Android operating system is the most popular mobile platform in the world with apps being available on numerous types of devices from a variety of manufacturers~\cite{androidpopularity_url}. This flexibly has both allowed the Android operating system to flourish, but results in many different hardware platforms for app developers to support.</p>
<p>\subsection{Android Application Structure}</p>
<p>The Android application stack is comprised of four primary layers. The top layer is the Android application layer, which is followed by the the three application framework layers. The Android Software Development Kit (SDK) allows developers to create Android applications using the Java programming language. Isolation between Android applications is enforced through the use of the Android sandbox~\cite{androidsecuritytips_url}, which prevents applications from intruding upon one another.</p>
<p>\emph{Intents} are a communication mechanism to exchange information between the components (\emph{Activities}) of an Android application, and are reported to the user upon installation and use. Inter Process Communication (IPC) is the composition mechanism performed using Intents which is used to invoke another application component. Attacks that exploit Intents for malicious reasons include ~\emph{permission collusion},~\emph{confused deputy} and~\emph{intent spoofing}~\cite{Chin:2011:AIC:1999995.2000018,grace2012systematic, Marforio:2012:ACC:2420950.2420958, 6641043}.</p>
<p>Android applications are packaged in APK files, which are compressed files of the application&rsquo;s binaries, package metadata, and sometimes source code. Table~\ref{Table:apkcontents} shows the breakdown of a typical APK file.</p>
<p>%% Much of this able came from : ~\cite{Lee_2013}</p>

<p>Android applications are available from a variety of different locations including AppksAPK\footnote{<a href="http://www.appsapk.com/">http://www.appsapk.com/</a>}, F-Droid\footnote{<a href="https://f-droid.org/">https://f-droid.org/</a>}, and the GooglePlay store\footnote{<a href="https://play.google.com/store">https://play.google.com/store</a>}. These stores differ from the iOS app store which forces all non-jailbroken devices to access applications through an Apple controlled store. GooglePlay provides verification of uploaded applications using a service called Bouncer which scans applications for malware~\cite{bouncer_url1}. However in spite of these efforts, malicious apps are sometimes found on the GooglePlay store~\cite{Zhou:2012:DAM:2310656.2310710}. GooglePlay separates apps into~\emph{Genres} based on their realm of functionality, some of which are Action, Business, Entertainment, Productivity, and Tools. The~\emph{AndroidManifest.xml} file contains a permissions and application information as defined by the developer.</p>
<p>\subsection{Android Permission Structure}<br />
Android developers operate under a permission-based system where apps must be granted access to various areas of functionality before they may be used. If an app attempts to perform an operation which it does not have permission, a~\emph{SecurityException} is thrown. When an Android app is created, developers must explicitly declare in advance which permissions the application will require~\cite{Felt:2011:APD:2046707.2046779}, such as the ability to write to the calendar, send SMS messages, or access the GPS.</p>
<p>When installing the application, the user is asked to accept or reject these requested permissions. Once installed, the developer cannot remotely modify the permissions without releasing a new version of the application for installation~\cite{shaerpour2013trends}. These security settings are stored in the AndroidManifest.xml file and include a wide range of permissions, some of which are~\emph{INTERNET},~\emph{READ_CONTACTS}, and ~\emph{WRITE_SETTINGS}. Unfortunately, developers often request more permissions than they actually need as there is no built in verification system to ensure that they are only requesting the permissions their application actually uses~\cite{Felt:2011:APD:2046707.2046779}.</p>
<p>A basic principle of software security is the~\emph{principle of least privilege}, or the granting of the minimum number of privileges that an application needs to properly function~\cite{saltzer1975protection}. Granting more privileges than the application needs creates security problems since vulnerabilities in other applications, or malware, could use these extra permissions for malicious reasons. Additionally, this limits potential issues due to non-malicious, developer errors. Unfortunately, due to the granularity of the permission spectrum used by Android, the developer must often grant more permissions to their application than it actually requires. For example, an application that needs to send information to one site on the internet will need to be given full permissions to the internet, meaning that it may communicate with with all websites~\cite{jeon2011dr}.</p>
<p>Thus, in this study, we use the term \emph{overprivilege} to describe a permission setting that grants more than what a developer needs for the task. Likewise, an \emph{underprivilege} is a setting for which the app could fail because it was not given the proper permissions. Overprivileges are considered security risks, underprivileges are considered quality risks.</p>

\section{App Collection \&amp; Static Analysis}</p>
<p>We analyzed 30,020 Android application files over a period of 3 months using a variety of different tools. The results were stored in a publicly accessible database located on our project website. Our methodology is as follows:</p>
<p>\begin{enumerate}<br />
  \item Collect APK files<br />
  \item Reverse-engineer binaries<br />
  \item Execute static analysis tools<br />
  \item Evaluation (see Section~\ref{sec: evaluation})<br />
\end{enumerate}</p>
<p>\label{sec: collection}<br />
\subsection{Step 1: Collect APK files}</p>
<p>We created the~\emph{Darwin}\footnote{<a href="http://darwin.rit.edu">http://darwin.rit.edu</a>} tool that downloads Android Application (.apk) files and invokes various static analysis tools against these files. The Android apk files were pulled from GooglePlay using a custom built collector using~\emph{Scrapy}~\cite{scrapy_URL} as a foundation. We chose to pull from GooglePlay since it is the most popular source of Android applications and was able to provide various application information such as the developer, version, genre, user rating and number of downloads. To limit the impact of seldom-downloaded applications, we divided of our results into two groups;\dan{correct ;?} applications with at least 10,000 downloads, and those with less than 10,000 downloads. Of the 30,020 applications downloaded, 12,215 had at lt least 10,000 downloads, while 17,805 had fewer.</p>
<p>%To limit the impact of seldom-downloaded applications, we only included applications with at least 10,000 downloads in our results. Of the 30,020 applications downloaded, 12,215 had at lt least 10,000 downloads, while 17,805 had fewer. In our presented results, unless otherwise noted the data set we will be referencing is the one comprising applications with at least 10,000 downloads. \dan{I added above&hellip;State why?}<br />
\dan{I updated this paragraph quite a bit to talk about the 10k downloads}</p>
<p>\subsection{Step 2: Reverse-engineer binaries}<br />
\label{sec: decompliation}</p>
<p>Some of our static analysis tools require source code instead of binary code, so we followed a reverse engineering process similar to that as proposed by previous research~\cite{Lee_2013,6687155}. For many of our static analysis tools, the downloaded APK files had to be decompiled to .java files. The first step was to unzip the .apk file using a simple unix command, which creates the files shown in~Table ~\ref{Table:apkcontents}. Next, we used two open source tools to complete the reverse engineering process. These were:</p>
<p>\begin{itemize}<br />
  \item \textbf{dex2jar~\cite{dex2jar_key}:} Convert the .dex file into a .jar file. A java jar command is then used to convert this to .class files.<br />
  \item \textbf{jd-cmd~\cite{jdcmd_key}:} A command line decompiler that converts .class files to .java.<br />
\end{itemize}</p>
<p>Additionally, we recorded the number of extracted class and java files. The de-compilation process is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:extractionprocess}.</p>

<p>\end{tikzpicture}<br />
\end{figure}<br />
\end{center}</p>
<p>\subsection{Step 3. Execute static analysis tools}<br />
\label{sec: analysis}</p>
<p>The next phase was to analyze the extracted source code for a variety of metrics, including potential security risks, permissions issues, potential non-security defects, and misuse of coding standards. We also collected information about software clones, which are functionally equivalent portions of an application that may differ syntactically. These are often a sign of poorly written software and may be detrimental to an application in a variety of ways including increased maintenance costs since changes will need to be done several times and inconsistent bug fixes~\cite{Roy:2009:CEC:1530898.1531101}. We used the following tools for our analysis:</p>
<p>\textbf{Stowaway\cite{Felt:2011:APD:2046707.2046779}:} Reports the overprivileges and underpriviledges of an application, which we recorded. We slightly modified the existing version of Stowaway to incorporate the tool into our process and work with current Android applications and their updated permissions. Permlyzer~\cite{6698893}, a more modern permission detection tool, was not used since its authors have not made it available for download.</p>
<p>\textbf{AndroRisk\cite{androguard_url}:} A component of the Androguard reverse engineering tool, this reports the risk indicator of an application for potential malware. We recorded the reported risk level for the apk file.</p>
<p>\textbf{CheckStyle\cite{checkstyle_key}:} A development tool to measure how well developers adhere to coding standards. Some of which include naming conventions, annotation usage, size violations and empty block checks. We recorded the total number of violations of these standards. Default application settings were used for our analysis.</p>
<p>\textbf{Jlint\cite{jlint_key}:} Examines java code to find bugs, inconsistencies and synchronization problems by conducting a data flow analysis and building lock graphs. We recorded the total number discovered bugs. This tool was selected over FindBugs~\cite{findbugs_key} since it was able to analyze the applications much faster, while still reporting accurate results~\cite{rutar2004comparison}.</p>
<p>\textbf{Simcad\cite{6613857}:} A powerful software clone detection tool which we used to record the number of clones discovered for each target application.</p>
<p>\textbf{APKParser~\cite{apkparser_link}:} A tool to read various information from an Android apk file including the version, intents, and permissions. We used the output from this tool to determine the application version, minimum sdk, target sdk, requested intents, and permissions. The permissions identified by APK Parser differ from those as identified by Stowaway since Stowaway reported the over and under privileges, while APK Parser merely found the requested permissions by the application and made no attempt to determine if they were used or not.<br />
We also recorded other metrics about each application including total lines of code, number of java files, application version, target SDK and minimum SDK.</p>
<p>% DK - Not sure if I should mention this part<br />
%Whenever we were forced to slightly alter an existing application, we ensured its quality by testing it against \todo{finish this}</p>
<p>% DK -  Should I do this?<br />
%\todo{Make sure to provide good justification for the use of selected tools. IE why was one tool chosen over another&hellip;}</p>
<p>Stowaway and Androrisk were able to analyze the raw apk files, while CheckStyle, Jlint and Nicad required the apk files to be decompiled. All results were recorded in an sqlite database, which is publicly available on the project website. The full analysis process is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:analysisprocess}.</p>

<p>We evaluate the reverse-engineered Android applications in a variety of ways including comparing the effects of the maturity level, comparing benign applications to malware, and comparing within genres.</p>

\subsection{RQ1: Does the number of potential security risks increase over time?}</p>
<p>%- How does quality change across genres<br />
%-  Which items are overpriviledged more often?<br />
We examined the effect the version of the application had on the observed quality for the application. All applications downloaded from GooglePlay were grouped together according to their application version. We separated all applications into six distinct groups based on their version, where applications with a version number of 0 - .99 being assigned to group 0, applications with the version of 1 - 1.99 went to group 1 and so on. We had 1225 applications with  indecipherable version information, so we ignored those in this analysis. We then averaged scores for the groups to determine their average AndroRisk score, number of overprivileges,  discovered defects, and adherence to coding standards. Adherence to coding standards was determined by dividing the number of mistakes found for each application, by the number of classes in it, with the same process being used to determine defects. AndroRisk, code clones and overprivileges were found by finding the average values of each for all applications in each group. User ratings were not considered since the ranges between the various groups were very small. Finally, to assist with the visual representation of the results, values were normalized in the chart to follow consistent values with one another, while retaining their accuracy. The results are shown in shown in Figure~\ref{fig:VersionEffect}.</p>
<p>These results indicate that \textbf{potentials risks increase with release number}. Not only did the risk grow over each version, but the number of overprivileges generally grew as well. This indicates that as applications evolve, the drive for features may be overcoming careful avoidance of vulnerabilities. This may come as a surprise to users who believe that with each update they receive better and better apps.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these results also indicate that, over time, developers may be paying more attention to small coding mistakes that JLint would find. However, code clones nearly triples over the first five releases, indicating the possibility that designs may be rotting and the~\emph{Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself} principle may be traded in for new feature. Interestingly, coding standards mistakes generally decreased despite the other quality-related problems generally increasing.</p>

<p>\subsection{RQ2: What are the most pervasive overprivileges?}</p>
<p>A basic principle of security is the granting of the least amount of privileges to an application which it needs to properly function. Granting extra privileges creates unnecessary security vulnerabilities. Previous research has found that while Android developers try to follow this principle, they often add extra privileges to make the app work properly, or due to confusion over the permission name where they believe its functionality sounds related to their app, so they add the unneeded permission~\cite{Felt:2011:APD:2046707.2046779}.</p>
<p>We analyzed the most overused permissions in 41 application genres ranging from Communication and Productivity, to Sports, Puzzles and Entertainment. We separated the applications into two groups, those with at least 10,000 downloads, and those with less\dan{word better}. In Table~\ref{Table:mostoverpermissions}, we show all permissions which had an overprivilege rate of at least 2.5\% in either group of downloads. Complete results may be found on the project website. \dan{I added the above statement}</p>

<p>Some widely occurring overprivileges in both groups were~\emph{GET_ACCOUNTS}, which permits access to the list of accounts in the accounts service.~\emph{READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE}  allows the application to read from an external storage device and ~\emph{CALL_PHONE} which allows an application to start a phone call without the user confirming it through the dialer interface~\cite{manifest_url}. The permission~\emph{GET_ACCOUNTS} is potentially dangerous since a malicious application could gain access to all device accounts.~\emph{READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE} is potentially dangerous since an application could be granted access to information which should it not be, while~\emph{CALL_PHONE} could allow a dangerous application to dial any phone number without the consent of the user.</p>
<p>We next examined overpriviledges which frequently occurred together in each group. In Table~\ref{Table:OverPrivsTogether}, we display all instances of permissions that occur together in at least 1.5\% of applications in either group of at least 10,000 downloads, and that of less than 10,000 downloads. Some of the commonly occurring overprivilege combinations in each group include CALL_PHONE and GET_ACCOUNTS,\dan{,Correct punctionation here?} which is dangerous since it would allow a malicious application to gather private account information and make possibly expensive calls, READ_PHONE_STATE and ACCESS_WIFI_STATE, and GET_ACCOUNTS and ACCESS_WIFI_STATE both allow malicious software to use the open ACCESS_WIFI_STATE open permission; which is frequently used to gather Personally Identifiable Information~\cite{Achara:2014:SPW:2627393.2627399}.</p>
<p>\dan{Did I explain these well enough}<br />
\dan{Andy: Can you take a look at this}<br />
\dan{I re-wrote above, check and proof.}</p>
<p>%~\emph{android.permission.CALL_PHONE} which allows an application to start a phone call without the user confirming it through the dialer interface. This was followed by~\emph{android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS}, which permits access to the list of accounts in the accounts service~\cite{manifest_url}. The permission ~\emph{GET_ACCOUNTS} is potentially dangerous since a malicious application could gain access to all device accounts, while~\emph{CALL_PHONE} could allow a dangerous application to dial any phone number without the consent of the user.</p>
<p>% In the observed applications, the combination of these overprivileges occurred 951 (3\%) times. When occurring in unison, these overprivileges are dangerous since a malicious application could again access to a user&rsquo;s contact list, and place calls to each. We next examined the rates in which overprivileges occur together. We found that~\emph{CALL_PHONE} and~\emph{GET_ACCOUNTS} occurred as overprivileges together in 3.17\% of all applications followed by~\emph{CALL_PHONE} and~\emph{SEND_SMS} with a rate of 2.57\%.

<p>&mdash; Add the updated analysis here</p>
<p>\dan{I updated this analysis}</p>
<p>Overall, we found that in applications with at least 10,000 downloads, 40.7\% had at least one over permission, while 25.8\% had at least 2, while 8.2\% at least 4, while the rates were higher for applications with less than 10,000 downloads. Using Stowaway, previous research in 2011 found that approximately 33\% of all applications were overprivileged with only about half of those containing more than one overprivilege and only 6\% requested more than four extra permissions~\cite{Felt:2011:APD:2046707.2046779}. This indicates that the rate of overprivileged applications are growing, along with the number of extra privileges for each of these applications.<br />

\dan{RQ3 was basically totally re-written}</p>
<p>We next compared the various application genres to examine their rates of overprivileges, which we computed by dividing the number of overprivileges for all applications in each genre by the total number of applications in each genre. We separated the results into applications with at least 10,000 total downloads and those with less than 10,000 downloads. We show the results of all genres with at least a ration of 2.0 or better for either download group in Table~\ref{Table:topOverGenre}, while complete results may be found on our project website.</p>
<p>We next found the top 10 genres which had at least one overprivilege. For applications with at least 10,000 downloads, we found that Communication application had a 77\% likelihood of having at least one overprivilege while Role Playing and Business were tied for second with an overprivilege of 68\%.

<p>\subsection{RQ4: Are benign apps measured as more secure when compared against known malware?}</p>
<p>We compared the results of the collected applications with at least 10,000 downloads from the GooglePlay store against 139 malware examples from the Contagio Mobile Mini Dump~\cite{contagio_url} and the Malware Genome Project~\cite{Zhou:2012:DAM:2310656.2310710} for the purpose of examining the differences between malicious apps, and ones which were considered to be benign. Since many of the malware examples represented only slight alterations from their counterparts, one result from each malware family was taken from the Malware Genome project to help limit the negative impact that families with many examples would have in creating bias results.</p>
<p>The compared areas included the adherence to coding standards, discovered defects, permission gap and the utilized intents \&amp; permissions. This was accomplished by running the malicious applications through the same process as the applications collected from the GooglePlay store, as was described in Sections~\ref{sec: decompliation} and~\ref{sec: analysis}. The results of this analysis are available in our public GitHub repository and are shown in Table~\ref{Table:maliciousvsnonmalicious}.</p>
<p>Most Android malware is piggybacked on existing applications whose malicious code is typically loosely coupled with the host application~\cite{Zhou:2012:DAM:2310656.2310710, Deshotels:2014:DAF:2556464.2556467}. We found that malicious applications had a much higher number of coding standards mistakes per class compared to their benign counterparts while also having a slightly higher number of defects per class. While we are not able to examine the development process of malware applications and interview its developers, we are able to draw several possible conclusions. Malware developers understandably likely care much less about the actual user experience as opposed to developers of reputable applications since they are less worried about things such as user complaints.  This could also caused by the fast paced nature that malware, and groups of malware are often developed in, one where developers do not have much time, or care for quality. Their only goal is to release as many versions of the malicious applications as quickly as possible. \todo{cite4}.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the malicious applications had a much higher ratio of overprivileges ($\frac{#overprivileges}{# apps} $) as compared to their benign counterparts. The top 10 most commonly occurring overprivileges, their rates, and how they differ from applications collected from the GooglePlay store, are shown in Table~\ref{Table:mal_permissions}. \todo{Check these values to make sure they are up to date}</p>
<p>%The~\emph{WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE} was the most occurring over permission an malicious applications. This permission is used to store information on an external storage device such as an SD card and is often used by malicious applications</p>
<p>%- Many of the other requested permissions are not surprising since they may be used to gather</p>

\label{sec:dataset}</p>
<p>Our data set is available from our publicly accessible GitHub repo~\footnote{<a href="https://github.com/DroidDarwin/">https://github.com/DroidDarwin/</a>}. The SQLite database is updated on a regular basis from our scanning and analysis application. The goal of this dataset is to allow future researchers to both learn and extend upon our work. This data includes the following fields for each app:</p>
<p>\begin{itemize}<br />
  \item Name<br />
  \item Version<br />
  \item Genre<br />
   \item Number of Downloads from GooglePlay<br />
  \item Publication date on GooglePlay<br />
  \item GooglePlay User Rating<br />
  \item Overprivileges<br />
  \item Underprivileges<br />
  \item Count of JLint reported defects<br />
  \item Count of CheckStyle coding standards mistakes<br />
  \item Application Size<br />
  \item Count of .java files<br />
  \item Vulnerability risk from AndroRisk<br />
  \item Code Clone count from Simcad<br />
\end{itemize}</p>
<p>Our public repository also includes our scripts for collecting the apps along with invoking the static analyis tools.</p>
<p>\section{Limitations}<br />
\label{sec:limitations}</p>
<p>Our maturity metric is based on the release version, and compares applications across release versions. Due to different interpretations of version numbers, developers may vary in the way they interpret, say versions 1.0 and 2.0\dan{reword}. However, since GooglePlay reviews can be filtered by version, developers have a low incentive to be releasing extremely often since that can effectively make positive reviews obsolete in the eyes of a potential customer. We do, however, expect some variation on maturity for the same version app numbers.</p>
<p>While Stowaway is a powerful statical analysis tool which has been used in a substantial amount of previous research~\cite{Pearce:2012:APS:2414456.2414498,Stevens_investigatinguser,jeon2011dr}, it does suffer some drawbacks. Malicious code may be obfuscated and unnecessary API methods inserted into the application, rationalizing the permission~\cite{6698893}. Static analysis techniques can also be hindered by the Java reflection and may lead to inaccuracies~\cite{Sridharan:2006:RCP:1133255.1134027}~\cite{Tripp:2009:TET:1542476.1542486}. These types of limitations are inherent to all static analysis tools.</p>
<p>We only analyzed applications from GooglePlay and not other sources such as AppksAPK or F-Droid, which would have led to more varied application origins. However, we feel the diversity of our applications was already quite robust since we collected 30,020 applications from 41 genres.</p>
<p>We also only examined free applications in our research due to cost constants. Thus, the measurements comparison of apps is not representative of the entire Android app market. Our results only apply as a comparison within free apps, not with paid apps.</p>
<p>%Also, Android runs code on the Dalvik Virtual Machine(DVM)\cite{Mirzaei:2012:TAA:2382756.2382798}, instead of the JVM. Some of the differences may exist between traditional Java and Android&rsquo;s Java.</p>
<p>\section{Related Work}<br />
\label{sec: relatedwork}</p>
<p>% \todo{This section needs to be changed to not just address the permissions gap}<br />
% \todo{make sure this section is really good, I can see people really scrutinized this.}</p>
<p>Android applications have been extensively researched in a numerous areas. The topic of reducing the permission gap in Android applications has received a considerable amount of attention recent years. Much of the existing work on this area has dealt with ways of reducing these unneeded permissions and the security vulnerabilities they may lead to. Jeon~\emph{et al.} introduced a framework for creating finer-grained permissions in Android. They believe that the course grained permissions currently used by Android limit developers by forcing them to choose all of the permissions located in each "bucket" when they really only want to add a few of them. This leads to applications having many more permissions than they actually require. The authors believe that finer-grained permissions would lead to only having the needed permissions used by an application, and thus lead to few vulnerability possibilities~\cite{jeon2011dr}.</p>
<p>Wei~\emph{et al.} studied the evolution of Android to determine if the platform was allowing the system become more secure. They found that the privacy and overall security in the overall Android system is not improving over time and that the principle of least privilege is not being adequately addressed~\cite{Wei:2012:PEA:2420950.2420956}.</p>
<p>There have been innumerable studies analyzing mobile applications on a large scale. Sarma~\emph{et al.} evaluated several large datasets, including one with 158,062 Android applications in order to gauge the risk of installing the application, with some of the results broken down by genre. However, this work did not analyze the application using the range of static analysis tools which we used. Viennot~\emph{et al.} developed a tool called PlayDrode which they used to examine the source code for over 1,100,000 free Android applications. While the authors examined a very large number of applications, they largely only used existing information which could be gathered from GooglePlay and while they carried out static analysis on the applications, they examined features such as library usage and duplicated code;\dan{correct puncuation} and not areas such as security vulnerability levels and overpriviledges as was conducted in our analysis.</p>
<p>While this work represents the largest known, empirical analysis of developers allowing overprivileges to occur in Android applications, it is not the first research into developers not following the principle of least privilege. Felt~\emph{et al.} described some common developer errors they found using their tool Stowaway, including confusing permission names, the use of depreciated permissions and errors due to copy and pasting existing code~\cite{Felt:2011:APD:2046707.2046779}. In another work,  Felt~\emph{et al.} very briefly described some inclinations they had for developers gave too many permissions to applications, but this was largely based on assumptions and not data~\cite{Felt:2011:EAP:2002168.2002175}.</p>
<p>%There have been several tools which have been developed to assist in the decision making, permission process for developers. Felt~\emph{et al.} created a tool known as~\emph{Stowaway} which uses a permissions-to-API calls maps in order to statically analyze request permissions in Android applications~\cite{Felt:2011:APD:2046707.2046779}. This tool notes the extra, unneeded permissions requested by the application, along with permissions that should have been requested, but were not. One criticism of this tool is that it may be difficult to determine if a permission is actually used through the use of static analysis.</p>
<p>Permlyzer is a tool which was built to determine where permissions are utilized in Android applications by using a mixture of static and runtime analysis~\cite{6698893}. This is a recently published tool, so it has not yet been discussed or used in a substantial amount of subsequent research. However, the authors were able to achieve promising results and this may be a powerful tool for assisting in the permissions granting decision process for developers. \emph{PScout} was another tool developed to extract permission specifications from Android applications using static analysis~\cite{Au:2012:PAA:2382196.2382222}. While the authors of this tool were able to achieve promising results, subsequent work has criticized this tool for not being accurate enough since Android&rsquo;s permissions could be different at runtime, which is something the tool is not capable of discovering~\cite{zhang2013vetting}.</p>
<p>Bartel~\emph{et al.} and Wei~\emph{et al.} also discussed some basic, high level discoveries about why developers make these mistakes~\cite{Bartel:2012:ASP:2351676.2351722}~\cite{Wei:2012:PEA:2420950.2420956}. While these works were beneficial for numerous reasons, none to date have explored the question of why developers do not adhere to the principle of least security nearly as much as they should.</p>

<p>\section{Conclusion}<br />
\label{sec: conclusion}</p>
<p>In this work, we demonstrated our technique of downloading and analyzing 30,020 Android applications in a variety of areas including its security vulnerability level, overprivileges, code clones, potential defects, and coding standards mistakes. We found that, in general, Android applications increase in their potential security risks over time, increase in their code clones, yet decrease in potential defects. We conducted our analysis within genres and found the results hold within the store genres. As a control, we compared our analysis results against known malware and found that the static analysis tools we employed demonstrated high levels of security risk where malware was known. These results provide a broad overview of the state of the most downloaded free apps in the GooglePlay store.</p>
