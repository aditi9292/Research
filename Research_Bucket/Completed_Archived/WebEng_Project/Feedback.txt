Recommend the following revisions:
X State the level of the course.
X State the number of students undertaking the course.
•As an important part of the investigation, survey questions in 
Table II are too rough and simple. This did not explored deep impact of 
the projects on a number of issues (software engineering process, project 
management, use of software tools, etc.) that were concerned in the 
delivery of the course by the authors. Recommend to expand Table II with 
these issues, if they had been covered by the survey. 
0 Split Section V into two sections: make a new Section II Related 
Work and a new Section V Evaluation and Challenges of the Project. Then 
move challenges part in Section VI to this new Section V. then make a new 
Section VIII Future Work.  
XAdd a reference for “the current share price is to be 
retrieved from a third party web service” on page 3.
X Remove repeated “level of” on page 3 under  “Week 1: Team Formation”.

X I don't know much about web engineering, but the paper is certainly 
appropriate to the FIE conference, well-organized, and well-written. The 
authors should proof-read it carefully for spelling and grammar. e.g., 
the word "areas" is spelled "ares" on page 2. Also, the next to last 
sentence in section I is actually two sentences. The course project is 
clearly described, with asessment, evaluation, peer reviews and a discussion 
of group difficulties. A very good paper.
