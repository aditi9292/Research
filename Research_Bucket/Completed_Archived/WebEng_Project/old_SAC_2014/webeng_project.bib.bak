  abstract = {This article derives lessons from the quality approach for further
	developing the organizational sustainability approach. Taking a responsibility
	perspective on organizational sustainability, four issues emerge
	that need to be resolved, i.e. what is the responsibility?, what
	is the responsibility area?, who is involved in determining responsibilities
	and area?, and, in what way is the organization able to take care
	of these responsibilities?. The article explores in what way the
	quality approach has been dealing with these issues, which is the
	basis for some lessons for the sustainability approach. An important
	lesson is that the who is involved question should be leading. The
	stakeholder who is willing to pay for sustainability dominates answering
	the other three issues. With respect to the accounting practices,
	sustainability programmes could be inspired by the same need for
	protective and accountable behaviour as quality programmes, if the
	well-known negative aspects are minimized.},
