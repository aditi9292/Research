\required{Project Summary}
% This should be a brief statement of the problem you plan to address.
% It should look something like an abstract.

Creating software which is on time, on budget, and is high quality is a difficult task; one which many software projects do not achieve. Building mobile software that achieves these goals, while being secure, is an even more daunting task. 

% Cite some studies here. 
% Give some numbers
% Show that a problem exists.
% Probably not a good idea to actually cite things


Insecure mobile software is created for a myriad of reasons, with some of the most prevalent being ignorance to proper security standards and protection techniques; but is largely due to the inability of the developer to incorporate these into the software development life-cycle of the application. Far too often, proper software development techniques, including security standards, are not used due to time or cost constraints on creating the application. Mobile applications tend to be released at a much faster pace, in comparison to their conventional software counterparts. This typically means that testing, for both security and functionality, needs to be conducted in an efficient manner. Additionally, while developers are often cognisant of making portions of the application more reusable or extensible, far fewer are able to plan for new or unforseen security updates when creating the application~\dan{change this?} While there are numerous
