Having different types working with me helps me to see that other people opinions matter and make for a better outcome.","I was more relaxed with the different types (D,I,C). When i moved to the all I's table i tended to be less relaxed, i'm thinking i might be a D and because all the I's were analyzing my every idea it put more pressure on me. I also wanted them to listen to me and not dazed off into other ideas so quickly. Where as when i was at the (D,I,C) table my ideas were received more easily and analyzed with me not so much as against me. With that said, it helped me to think about my own personality and how i should adjust accordingly when dealing with people in general.","5","Excellent","5","Excellent"

Likely, that was because of the ""pressure"" of needing to figure out a slogan. The group I was in was a little confused on how to get the ball rolling, and being too aggressive/taking on any form of a leader role was difficult. Honestly, it felt like (in terms of this activity) there was a sort of personality clash.","It was actually very easy to work with the same personality type as my own. Supportive people all tend to understand one another, and it's far easier to come up with ideas, and then bounce them around sharing stories. Simply it was very easy to work together.","Still thinking on that.","The reveal wasn't until after the activity, so there was no preface/context for going into and interacting with different personality groups.","4","Above Average","4","Above Average"
