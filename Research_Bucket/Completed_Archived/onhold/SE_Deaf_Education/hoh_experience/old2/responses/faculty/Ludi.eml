Hi Dan,

I will be out next week but I will be checking email in the afternoons.

You will want to look closely at how similar type of papers are done in sig=
cse as since there is not data or case study, there will be no data to show=
 whether it be qualitative or quantitative..


I have not had a lot of students, of those who have discussed accommodation=
s I have had something like 4 students total.  3 of those 4 students have u=
sed interpreters, but I don't know if they used note-takers.  None asked fo=
r extended time on tests.  Access to slides ahead of time was asked by 1 or=
 2.  But that is it.

The students use/used interpreters during team meetings and presentations (=
except for the 1 student who read lips).

During faculty orientations a presentation was given and for me that was fi=
ne as I had and continue to have experience working with students with vari=
ous disabilities.  It may be of interest to you to get some of those materi=
als.

I can answer some of the other questions below.

--Steph

Hi Steph,

Sorry for being all over the place with this email, there are a lot of smal=
l pieces of information I was hoping to cover with you.

I've been working on the education paper we discussed. For now, I think I w=
ould like to focus on hearing impaired students. Some areas I would like to=
 cover are:

 *   Our experiences in SE with hearing impaired students.
 *   Some things which have gone well and other things would could be impro=
ved upon
 *   Improvements we plan to make in the future.
 *   Some of our "lessons learned"

Thus far, I've begun writing the paper and am about 2.5 pages into it. I've=
 reached out to both Sara and a contact I have in NTID to gather some infor=
mation. Some of which includes the number of hearing impaired students in t=
he Galisano college and in SE along with their graduation rates (I am not s=
ure if they will be able to provide that information, but I figured I would=
 ask anyways.)

Assuming you are still on board with things, I was envisioning you as the s=
econd author and my girlfriend who is a speech language pathologist as the =
third author. She would provide insight on the deaf community and future ed=
ucational techniques we may wish to employ in SE.

I would like to shoot for a full paper (6 page) submission to SIGCE (http:/=
/sigcse2014.sigcse.org/authors/papers.php) with a due date of September 6th=
. If it doesn't get in here, we could also shoot for FIE in the spring, or =
even another conference before that.

I will be on campus much of next week, perhaps we can set up a time for us =
all to sit down quickly and go over things in person if you'd like.

Right now, I am looking for a few things from you. One is any general recom=
mendations you have for the paper. Are there any key areas you think we are=
 missing? Any extra data you think we can collect? Also, I was hoping you c=
ould answer this questions regarding your experiences with having hearing i=
mpaired students in some of your classes. I may pose these same questions t=
o Mike & Jim to see if they can assist as well. Feel free to add to the lis=
t.



 *
What roles do hearing impaired students usually play in teams? (IE team coo=
rdinator, testing coordinator etc...)

-- I don't know as the 4 students have been spread across 12 years.  The cu=
rrent student I have is a developer but also has a testing role.

 *
What problematic areas do your hearing impaired students have in your cours=
es? What has gone well?

-- when the students abuse their accommodations or do other things during c=
lass is a problem -- it was an issue with 1 student and it even frustrated =
the interpreter;  most everything goes well when they have their accommodat=
ions there and they use them

 *
What have you seen help acclimate hearing impaired students work with teams=
?

-- that the other students are used to having deaf/hard of hearing (you wan=
t to use these terms BTW) in their classes

 *
Are there any other services you feel the university could offer?

-- the D/HH students are offered so many services at RIT, I can't think of =
what they are not getting.

 *
Do you feel like you were prepared to properly educate hearing impaired stu=
dents?

-- yes, see comment above

 *
What general recommendations do you have for educating hearing impaired stu=
dents?

-- have the same expectations for them as you have for anyone else; follow =
best practices (e.g. talk to them not interpreter, make sure they can see y=
our lips when you are speaking and not speak too fast otherwise the interpr=
eter has a hard time, use closed captioned videos when using videos.

 *
What support services, if any, have hearing impaired students used in your =
classes?

-- noted in my comments above

 *


I have a GoogleDoc with the paper outline as well as some information on it=
 I could share with you if you'd like. Just let me know your Google usernam=
e.
-- sure no problem, it is steph.ludi@gmail.com<mailto:steph.ludi@gmail.com>

Thanks and take care
