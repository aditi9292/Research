  abstract = {This paper reports the findings of three studies within a program
	of research designed to better understand the factors contributing
	to the academic achievement of students in online courses and the
	contributions of interaction to online learning. The first study
	compared the academic achievement of students in the online and face-to-face
	(F2F) sections of multiple courses. In the second study, an online
	survey was used to obtain student perceptions of course satisfaction,
	learning, and communication. These factors were then related, using
	binary logistic regression analysis, to the amount of interaction
	that occurred in the students’ respective online courses; information
	from the myCourses course management system was used to quantify
	the amount of interaction that occurred in online courses. In the
	final study, both datasets were used to examine the academic achievement
	of students in online courses based upon the amount of interaction
	that had actually occurred. Whenever possible, a subgroup of deaf
	and hard-of-hearing students was included in the study to increase
	our understanding of the role that communication plays in the teaching-learning
	process. Our findings indicate that students enrolled in online courses,
	especially those designed with high levels of online interaction,
	receive higher grades and report greater learning than students in
	comparable F2F courses. In addition, online courses appear to provide
	deaf and hard-of-hearing students with special benefits in terms
	of academic achievement through online discussion. Overall, the studies
	illuminate how the quantity of interaction in online discussions
	relates to important success factors. Students in online courses
	with more interaction outperformed students in online courses with
	less interaction.},

	deaf students, on average, came into and left the classroom with

	communication (sign and speech together) and American Sign Language
	(ASL) apparently were equally effective for deaf students’ learning
	of the material. Students’ self-rated sign language skills were
	not significantly related to performance. Two new findings were of
	particular importance. First, direct and mediated instruction (via
	interpreting) were equally effective for deaf college students under
	the several conditions employed here. Second, despite coming into
	the classroom with the disadvantage of having less content knowledge,
	deaf students’ gain scores generally did not differ from those
	of their hearing peers. Possible explanations for these findings
	are considered.},

	full access to the content and social life in a hearing classroom
	can be challenging, and there are many aspects of the educational
	placement that can affect success. The skills and knowledge of the
	educational interpreter are one critical aspect. This study reports
	results from a study of approximately 2,100 educational interpreters
	from across the United States. All the interpreters were evaluated
	using the Educational Interpreters Performance Assessment (EIPA),
	an evaluation instrument used to assess and certify classroom interpreters
	(see Schick, Williams, & Bolster, 1999). The results show that approximately
	60% of the interpreters evaluated had inadequate skills to provide
	full access. In addition, educational interpreters who had completed
	an Interpreter Training Program had EIPA scores only .5 of an EIPA
	level above those who had not, on average. Demographic data and its
	relationship with EIPA ratings are explored. In general, the study
	suggests that many deaf and hard-of-hearing students receive interpreting
	services that will seriously hinder reasonable access to the classroom
	curriculum and social interaction.},
