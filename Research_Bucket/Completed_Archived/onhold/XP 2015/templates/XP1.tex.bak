\begin{abstract}        % give a summary of your paper
Agile software development advocates iterative incremental development of architecture, where the architectural solutions are devised as new requirements are discovered. The quality of software is largely dependent upon the underlying architectural decisions at the framework, tactic, and pattern levels. Unfortunately, few tools are capable of fully supporting software architecture development which work well with agile development practices and culture. In this research paper, we present our Eclipse plug-in named~\emph{Archie} as a solution for integrating architecture activities into agile development environments. Archie automates the detection of architectural tactics such as heartbeat, resource pooling, and role-based access control (RBAC) in the source code of a project; and constructs traceability links between the tactics, design models, rationales and source code. These are then used to monitor the environment for architecturally significant changes and to keep developers informed of underlying design decisions and their associated rationales.

\section{Conclusion}
Archie includes additional features which we are unable to present here. However, Archie's primary was developed to support secure software development. However the automated features of Archie make it a unique tool for agile teams as well. The primarily contribution of Archie is in the area of architectural centric support and preservation of architecture through detecting and tracing architectural concerns, and then using these trace links to keep developers fully informed of underlying architectural knowledge.
