\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}\todo{update based on findings}\noindent \textbf{Summary}: We statically analyzed more than 1,600 Android apps (both high-rating and low-rating apps) for security threats and found that high-rated apps typically had lower security based issues but higher permission based issues as compared to low-rated apps. \noindent \textbf{Recommendations}: Even though high-rated apps have greater risks in most cases, the use of static analysis tools is feasible for understanding security related issues. Therefore, we recommend that app developers run these static analysis tools on their apps before releasing them as they have an opportunity to correct issues before end users download, use and rate their apps.
