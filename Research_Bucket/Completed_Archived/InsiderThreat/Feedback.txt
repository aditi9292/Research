DK -  Completed initial review 6/5

I find the work interesting and well structured.
My only concern is that the impact of the activity on the learning of the 
students is measured
only through the personal opinion of students. I think more neutral 
measuring should be used.
There are a few typos that should be fixed:
? page 2, column 1, line 25 is not justified to the right
X page 3, column 2, lines 7-1: I would write "parties. It was..."
X page 4, column 1, line 30: "to ask" (there are two "to")
X section IV, line 5: "regarding the project"
x page 5, column 1, line 31: "how they" (there are two "how")
X page 5, column 1, line 38-39: "learning techniques" appears repeated
-and many mistakes in the references:
[1] the publication, pages...
X [2] why are the page numbers repeated? (223:223-223:230)
X [3] should CS0 be in capital letters?
o [5] two periods at the end. Publisher, pages?
o [6] , between first and second authors, the title is repeated. What is the 
book? pages?
X [10] there is a space before the author. Should "Geeks" be in capital 
letter?
X[11] book or conference?
X [13] goes out of the margin
