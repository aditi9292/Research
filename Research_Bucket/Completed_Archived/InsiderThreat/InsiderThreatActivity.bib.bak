  title = {Vulnerability of the day: concrete demonstrations for software engineering
	undergraduates},
  year = {2013},
  pages = {1154--1157},
  abstract = {Software security is a tough reality that affects the many facets
	of our modern, digital world. The pressure to produce secure software
	is felt particularly strongly by software engineers. Todays software
	engineering students will need to deal with software security in
	their profession. However, these students will also not be security
	experts, rather, they need to balance security concerns with the
	myriad of other draws of their attention, such as reliability, performance,
	and delivering the product on-time and on-budget. At the Department
	of Software Engineering at the Rochester Institute of Technology,
	we developed a course called Engineering Secure Software, designed
	for applying security principles to each stage of the software development
	lifecycle. As a part of this course, we developed a component called
	Vulnerability of the Day, which is a set of selected example software
	vulnerabilities. We selected these vulnerabilities to be simple,
	demonstrable, and relevant so that the vulnerability could be demonstrated
	in the first 10 minutes of each class session. For each vulnerability
	demonstration, we provide historical examples, realistic scenarios,
	and mitigations. With student reaction being overwhelmingly positive,
	we have created an open source project for our Vulnerabilities of
	the Day, and have defined guiding principles for developing and contributing
	effective examples. },
