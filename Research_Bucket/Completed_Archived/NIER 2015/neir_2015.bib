	have been created to automatically partition a software system into
	meaningful subsystems. While these techniques have demonstrated their
	effectiveness, we observe that a key feature within most software
	systems has not been fully exploited: most well-designed systems
	follow strong architectural design rules that split the overall system
	into modules. These design rules are often manifested as special
	program constructs, such as shared data structures or abstract interfaces,
	which should not belong to any of the subordinate modules. We contribute
	a new perspective of architecture recovery based on this rationale,
	which enables the combination of design-rule-based clustering with
	other clustering techniques, as well as enabling the splitting of
	a large system into subsystems. We evaluated our approach both quantitatively
	and qualitatively, using both open source and real industrial software
	projects.},

  abstract = {Since modern software systems are large and complex, appropriate abstractions
	of their structure are needed to make them more understandable and,
	thus, easier to maintain. Software clustering techniques are useful
	to support the creation of these abstractions by producing architectural-level
	views of a system's structure directly from its source code. This
	paper examines the Bunch clustering system which, unlike other software
	clustering tools, uses search techniques to perform clustering. Bunch
	produces a subsystem decomposition by partitioning a graph of the
	entities (e.g., classes) and relations (e.g., function calls) in
	the source code. Bunch uses a fitness function to evaluate the quality
	of graph partitions and uses search algorithms to find a satisfactory
	solution. This paper presents a case study to demonstrate how Bunch
	can be used to create views of the structure of significant software
	systems. This paper also outlines research to evaluate the software
	clustering results produced by Bunch.},
